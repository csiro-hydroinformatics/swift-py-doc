This is a copy of the python package `swift2`, perhaps the latest and as described in the documentation, but it may lag a bit. The "point of truth" for the package resides in a private repository alongside the C++ code it wraps.

This copy is provided for the curious, and as material for at least one potential bug report to a third party. The file [swift_api.md](./swift_api.md) may be used as example for [toolslm](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/toolslm) if bug repro is confirmed.
