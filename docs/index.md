# Python swift2 documentation

Documentation for the Python package **swift2**, a package for ensemble hydrologic modelling.

## Installation

See [Onboarding guide for streamflow forecasting software tools](https://csiro-hydroinformatics.github.io/streamflow-forecasting-tools-onboard)

## License

The swift2 python package itself is licensed with the [BSD 3-Clause Licence](./license.md)

## Source code

The package source code "point of truth" is at [this private repository](https://bitbucket.csiro.au/projects/SF/repos/swift/browse/bindings/python/swift2?at=refs%2Fheads%2Ftesting), however a copy is also in the repository [csiro-hydroinformatics/swift-py-doc](https://github.com/csiro-hydroinformatics/swift-py-doc/).

## LLM context files

Using LLMs for development is a best practice way to get started and explore. While LLMs **cannot code for you**, they can be helpful assistants. You must check, refactor, test, and vet any code any LLM generates for you - but they are helpful productivity tools. The following files will be useful as context for LLMs to build modelling workflows with the **swift2** package.

<!-- - [llms.txt](https://csiro-hydroinformatics.github.io/swift-py-doc/llms.txt): Links to what is included
- [llms-ctx.txt](https://csiro-hydroinformatics.github.io/swift-py-doc/llms-ctx.txt): Programming API pages -->

These files follow the proposed [/llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org), and are produced with [mkdocs-llmstxt](https://pawamoy.github.io/mkdocs-llmstxt/).
