## LLM context files

Using LLMs for development is a best practice way to get started and explore. While LLMs **cannot code for you**, they can be helpful assistants. You must check, refactor, test, and vet any code any LLM generates for you - but they are helpful productivity tools. The following files will be useful as context for LLMs to build modelling workflows with the **swift2** package.

- [llms.txt](https://csiro-hydroinformatics.github.io/swift-py-doc/llms.txt): Links to what is included
- [llms-ctx.txt](https://csiro-hydroinformatics.github.io/swift-py-doc/llms-ctx.txt): Programming API pages

These files follow the proposed [/llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org), and are produced with [mkdocs-llmstxt](https://pawamoy.github.io/mkdocs-llmstxt/).
